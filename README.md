# LFR-BASIC-ALGORITHM
This code reads digital inputs from 5 IR sensors, then converts the BCD (binary coded decimal) to INT and follow cases by switch statement based on Bang-Bang approach to follow a line. The code also remembers left or right turns made by the robot to avoid overshooting i.e deviation of the bot from the line by counter-balancing the last turn made.
